Sales Dashboard Analysis – Tableau Project

Project Overview

The dashboard is built to help stakeholders answer key business questions like:
- How have monthly sales trended over time?
- Which sub-categories drive the most revenue?
- Who are the top customers based on sales volume?
- How does sales performance vary across states and regions?
